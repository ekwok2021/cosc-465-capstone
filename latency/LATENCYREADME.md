Latency Game

In this game you will be calculating the latency given size, distance, and bandwidth. As you may remember from class in order to calculate latency, we need to add proposition delay and transmission delay. Proposition delay is a function of distance and transmission delay is a function of size and bandwidth. We will be using 2 x 10^8 m/s as the speed of light.
