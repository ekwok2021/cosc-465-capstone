## Description
There are five folders each containing a game file and associated files. The games are similar in style but different in purpose. Each game is based on pygame (for installing pygame, check out https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) but 
requires a different algorithm to generate questions. Each game generates questions with random metrics for players to answer. Please see description of each game in 
`readme` in each folder.

## Review
This project was inspired by the various activities we did throughout the Computer Networks course and aimed to serve as useful educational material for future students 
taking this course. We have reached the goal we set in our proposal. Although the process did not go strictly with the plan, our group made a good progress each time 
we met. After working together on the first game, each of us made another game based on the first one. By splitting the work almost equally, we were efficient. 
And by meeting and discussing, we shared strategies and fixed common bugs.  
  
However, there is always room for future improvement. There can be a better-looking user interface, a better organization of codes, and more complex game mechanics. 
Knowing this, We are still satisfied with the current product, as we are confident that it will be useful.
