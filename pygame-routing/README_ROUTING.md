This is a routing pygame dedicated to test students' understanding of Valley-Free routing, basically, users need to find a valid path from the starting AS to the
destination AS, and try not to violate the rules of Valley-Free.
_For installing pygame, check this link: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted__  
  **The basic funtionality is described below:**

**Generating graph**   
 The pygame takes json files in the topologies folder and generate starting graphs, there are only three json files right now so only three graphs are available. 
 The starting and destination ASes are randomized, notice that there might be situations that you cannot get to the destination without violating the Valley-free rule, 
 and just have to lose and restart again, therefore, this game does not have a losing condition.
 
 **Tutorial & Buttons**   
 There's a tutorial page available in the game page. Buttons are also available for users to choose what they want to do next (e.g. replay the current level or go to the
 next one)
 
 **Gameplay**   
 The game is click-based, meaning that users just need to click to go to the next AS available, they can reclick the last AS activated to cancel that step, but they can only 
 perform it once for every move. When the destination AS is reached without violating the rule, the user wins and can go to the next level. There are only three levels
 available for now, whenever users beat(or lose) the level, the starting/destination AS gets randomized again, making the games replayable.
